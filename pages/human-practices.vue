                <p >
                  The origins of ColoEcho stem from our fascination with the distinct acoustic properties of gas-filled molecules, 
                  which can be contrasted to that of normal tissues and detected by ultrasound imaging. 
                  Our journey officially began after conversing with one of our team member’s head of department, 
                  who extensively researches the therapeutic application of such molecules, specifically microbubbles. 
                  This discussion expanded our perspective on the vast potential for widening the clinical application of ultrasound. 
                  Upon further research, we discovered a biological alternative to microbubbles known as gas vesicles. 
                  These structures are formed by certain proteins that are expressed in select aquatic bacteria species. 
                  The ability to condition its expression and, thus, the signal, makes gas vesicles a well-suited component 
                  for an ultrasound-detectable biosensor.
