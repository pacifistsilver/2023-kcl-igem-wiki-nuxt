                Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide and the second most deadly. According to the
                World Health Organization (WHO), there were more than 1.9 million new cases of colorectal cancer in 2020
                and over 930,000 deaths. This problem does not appear to be reaching a resolution as the WHO expects an
                increase to 3.2 million new cases per year by 2040 (63% increase) and 1.6 million deaths per year (73%
                increase). In the UK alone, colorectal cancer is the second most deadly cancer, constituting 10% of all
                cancer deaths. However, the morality rate of colorectal cancer can be significantly reduced if it is
                identified in the earlier stages. According to Cancer Research UK, about 10% of those diagnosed with
                stage 4 colorectal cancer will survive for 5 years or more post-diagnosis, but if diagnosed in the
                earlier stages (stages 1 and 2), about 85-90% of people will survive for 5 years or more. Despite this,
                early detection of colorectal cancer is difficult to achieve as it is often asymptomatic and significant
                symptoms such as polyps, colon disfiguration, substantial tumour size, and abdominal pain generally
                manifest after stage 2 (Ann, 2006). Current detection methods also do not allow for accessible or
                routine screening, which hinders rates of early diagnosis.

                Cancer: Defining
                the problem</h3>
              <p>The gold standard test for colorectal cancer is the colonoscopy. The procedure involves the insertion
                of a scope through the anus into the colorectal region. If a polyp is present, it is biopsied and
                checked for the presence of colorectal cancer. However, due to the highly invasive nature of the
                colonoscopy, there are risks associated with the procedure, such as bleeding and perforations. Hence,
                colonoscopies should not be carried out repeatedly as this could put patients at an unnecessary risk for
                complications.
              </p>

              <p>Another alternative to the colonoscopy is the virtual colonoscopy that utilises CT-scan technology to
                screen for malignant tissue in the colon lining without the insertion of a scope. While less invasive
                than conventional colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopies are associated with risks related to ionising
                radiation exposure and should also not be used repeatedly.
              </p>

              <p>Moreover, the imaging requires the patient's colon to be inflated by a tube inserted through the anal
                canal
                which can lead to bloating and overall patient discomfort. The invasive nature of current diagnostic
                methods a
                lso often discourages individuals from seeking these procedures unless they exhibit symptoms of CRC.
                Unfortunately, early-stage CRC is typically asymptomatic, and significant symptoms such as polyps,
                colon disfiguration, substantial tumour size, and abdominal pain generally manifest after stage 2
                (Duke's B-D) (Ann, 2006). These challenges, combined with the lack of inclusivity of the younger age
                group in existing screening programs, contribute to the underdiagnosis of early-stage CRC cases
                in the United Kingdom.
              </p>
              <p>In the UK, the current routine screening method for colorectal cancer is the faecal immunochemical test
                (FIT). The FIT is an at-home stool sample test given to individuals aged 50-74 every 2 years. The test
                works by detecting the presence of blood in the stoolâ€”a symptom often implicated in colorectal cancer.
                However, it is important to note that blood may not always be present in the stool of those with
                colorectal cancer, particularly in the early stages. The FIT requires a colonoscopy to confirm
                malignancy, but because the test is oversensitive it can lead to unnecessary colonoscopies. The FIT is
                the only currently available test that can be utilised as a routine screening method, but it alienates
                the younger age group that is also becoming increasingly more susceptible to colorectal cancer. </p>
              <p>Overall, the invasive nature, potential risks/complications, and lack of accessibility of current
                detection methods promotes negative stigma, discouraging individuals from getting tested, prolonging
                diagnosis, and delaying treatment.</p>

                ColoEcho </h3>
              <p>Recognising the challenges associated with the diagnosis of colorectal cancer, ColoEcho is committed to
                devising a non-invasive and patient-friendly screening method that can be seamlessly integrated into the
                healthcare system. ColoEcho is an ultra-sound based diagnostic tool aimed for the early detection of
                colorectal cancer. The use of ultrasound technology makes ColoEcho non-invasive, cost-efficient, and
                easily accessible. This allows for ColoEcho to be implemented as a routine screening method for those at
                higher risk (e.g., age and genetic predisposition).
              </p>

              <p>The development of ColoEcho begins with the engineering of E. coli Nissel to induce production of gas
                vesicles. Gas vesicles are proteins produced by aquatic bacteria to aid in flotation, but we are able to
                utilise them as a contrast agent in ultrasound due to their acoustic properties. The acoustic properties
                of gas vesicles comes from their non-linear oscillation that differs from the linear oscillation of
                tissue and bone.
              </p>
              <p>
                The diagnostic process will work by prescribing the patient a pill containing the engineered E. coli and
                instructing them to take it 7 hours before their ultrasound appointment. In the presence of a solid
                tumor, L-lactate, a prominent metabolite, is present in elevated concentrations in the colon. When the
                engineered E. coli come into contact with this elevated levels of L-lactate, the LldR transcription
                regulator protein will bind to the lactate. This binding event triggers the activation of our promoter
                system and subsequently, downstream expression of the bacterial acoustic reporter gene derived
                fromÂ Serratia (bARGSer). This particular gene cluster holds the blueprint for the synthesis of gas
                vesicles. These gas vesicles can then be detected through an ultrasound scan. If the gas vesicles are
                present on the scan, it is likely that the patient has colorectal cancer and will then be sent for a
                colonoscopy for a biopsy to confirm the presence of colorectal cancer. However, in the absence of a
                solid tumor, L-lactate levels remain unchanged. Without this key metabolite, the cascade leading to the
                production of gas vesicles is not triggered, ensuring that no gas vesicles are synthesised and no
                contrast will be seen on the ultrasound scan.

                This figure provides a vivid depiction of the gas vesicle (GV) structure. Characterized by its unique

                and offers a scale reference, highlighting its nanoscale dimensions. This compact size, coupled with its
                distinctive structure, underscores the vesicle's ability to resonate effectively with ultrasound waves.Æ’
              </p>
              <p>The current lactate inducible promoter system we identified through literature review was determined to
                be leaky, in that, when there was no lactate present, gene expression would still occur. In order to
                tackle this problem, we designed a promoter construct system consisting of three BIOFAB promoters and
                three ribosomal binding sites all of varying strengths (weak, medium, strong). We used this construct
                system to determine which combination of promoter and ribosomal binding site would be ideal to combat
                the leakiness of the system and create a precise diagnostic tool. This promoter construct system is
                available for other iGEM teams and researchers to mix and match promoters and ribosomal binding sites
                depending on their desired outcome.

                  Colorectal Cancer</h3>
                <p>As a diverse team, many of our members come from regions where late-stage colorectal diagnoses are
                  common due to insufficient screening programs and poor disease awareness. These late-stage diagnoses
                  significantly reduce effective treatments, resulting in poorer prognoses and high mortality rates. We
                  understand the profound implications of this disease, which can impact any individual, regardless of
                  age or gender. This prompted us to contribute to the fight against colorectal cancer with the aim of
                  enhancing early diagnosis and, consequently, improving patient survival outcomes.
